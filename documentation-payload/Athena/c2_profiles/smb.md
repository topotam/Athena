## Summary


The athena agent can act as an SMB Client, sending messages through any supported SMB Server profiles.

Note: Agents only support 1 to 1 mapping, meaning 1 SMB Client to 1 SMB Server, however these can be chained.

### Profile Option Deviations

This profile makes no deviations from the standard `smb` profile provided.
